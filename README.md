- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThePoetics
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about using git as a repository for my own projects, both past and present
- 🌱 I’m currently learning simple game dev using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- 📫 You can reach me at https://poeticsonline.net, my personal blog where I (occasionally) also write about tech stuff

<!---
ThePoetics/ThePoetics is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
